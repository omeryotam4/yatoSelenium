This code is shown as part of SciFiDevCon 2023.
It's accompanying the plot of my Noragami presentation, and includes the basic process that was executed on a Mentimeter presentation I built specifically for the story.
To recreate the website, you can create a word cloud with 3 options in the mentimeter website- it's free!
An important step is to change the link in all driver.get() commands to your own link.
The original link should be running up to a week from the presentation day, meaning May 17, 2023.

To build the project, run 'mvn install' from your local project root directory.
